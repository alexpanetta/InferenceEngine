Features
- Forward Chaining
- Backward Chaining
- Truth Tabling

Bugs:
Truth tabling outputs '2', while it should have outputted '3' according to the documents swinburne has provided.

Missing:
None. All 3 functions have been implemented.

Test cases:

These two sites (above) have helped us with understanding the workings of truth tabling and has helped us complete 
the truth table.

This site has helped start us off with understanding how the code should look like and what it should be 
doing, as well as helping with understanding Forward Chaining better.

This site has provided us extra information on each of the functions (ie. FC, BC, TT) and their 
pseudocodes, thus giving us some sort of an understanding how the program would 'look' like.

Team members have been in contact through instant messaging (Slack group). It is also here that feedback is given to each other.
A code repository on github has allowed us to review and collaborate on coding from anywhere. Before another member's code is merged
to the master branch, the other member has to review it so as to agree that the code is suitable to be merged to the master branch.
This is to prevent errors from occurring as well as prevent conflicts within the repository.
